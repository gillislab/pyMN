    "# Protocol 2: Assessing cell type replicability against a pre-trained reference taxonomy\n",
    "\n",
    "Protocol 2 demonstrates how to assess cell types of a newly annotated dataset against a reference cell type taxonomy. Here we consider the cell type taxonomy established by the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) in the mouse primary motor cortex. The BICCN taxonomy was defined across a compendium of datasets sampling across multiple modalities (transcriptomics and epigenomics), it constitutes one of the richest neuronal resources currently available. When matching against a reference taxonomy, we assume that the reference is of higher resolution than the query dataset, i.e. the query dataset samples the same set or a subset of cells compared to the reference.\n",

    "We note two properties of matching against a pre-trained reference. First, replicable cell types have a clear top match in each of the reference dataset. Sst Chodl (long-projecting interneurons) match to similarly named clusters in the BICCN with an AUROC > 0.9999, Pvalb Cpne5 (Chandelier cells) match with the Pvalb Vipr2_2 cluster with AUROC > 0.93. Second, we have to be beware of false positives. For example, Sst Chodl secondarily matches with the L6b Ror1 cell types with AUROC > 0.98. When we use a pre-trained model, we only compute AUROCs with the reference data as the train data, so we cannot identify reciprocal hits. If we had been able to use \"Tasic|Sst Chodl\" as the training cluster, its votes would have gone heavily in favor of the BICCN's Sst Chodl, making L6b Ror1 a low AUROC match. Because of the low dimensionality of gene expression space, we expect false positive hits to occur just by chance (cell types reusing similar pathways) when a cell type is missing in the query dataset. Here L6b Ror1 (an excitatory type) had no natural match with the Tasic inhibitory cell types and voted for its closest match, long-projecting interneurons.\n",

    "There are three alternatives to separate true hits from false positive hits. First, if a cell type is highly replicable, it will have a clear top matching cluster in the reference dataset. Second, if the query dataset is known to be a particular subset of the reference dataset (e.g., inhibitory neurons as was the case here), we recommend subsetting the reference taxonomy to that subset. Third, if the first two solutions don't work, it is possible to go back to reciprocal testing by using the full BICCN dataset instead of the pre-trained reference.\n",
