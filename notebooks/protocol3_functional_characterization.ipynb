    "Protocol 3 demonstrates how to characterize functional gene sets contributing to cell type identity. In this section, we will focus on the characterization of inhibitory neuron subclasses as provided by the BICCN. The BICCN has shown that subclasses are strongly replicable across datasets and provided marker genes that are specific to each subclass. MetaNeighbor can be used to further quantify which pathways contribute to the subclasses' unique biological properties.\n",
